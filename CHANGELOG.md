## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-29
### BUGS
- Started with React => 데드라인 바뀌고 next로 변경
- Dowloaded Three.js
- Dowloaded field but lack of quality, mismatch of field specifications (tried using blender but no luck - need more time/learning to actually fix the field)

## [1.0.1] - 2025-03-30
### BUGS
- Bought the field from SketchFab
- Text not working with three 0.175.0 => downgraded to 0.174.0 😠
- Used line2, meshline to draw thick lines (due to webgl fixed linewidth 1) 
- Meshline had uneven lines when drawn to the field's fan shape, so used line2 intead
- Line2 had problem updating the ball's trejectory, so used meshline instead
